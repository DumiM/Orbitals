#Sprint 1 Review
	Got the gravity mechanics of the game working and implemented a initial GUI for the game.

##New features
+ Accurate gravitational mechanics implemented and working.
+ A basic GUI implemented to help visualise the physics ![screenshot](sprint_1_end.jpg)
+ Unit tests implemented with working folder structures

##Features failed to add
+ the chosen CI platform was not compatible with SwinGame, therfore the CI aspect of the project was decided to be abandoned.

##Suggestions for the next Sprint
+ Implement input. Allow users to create space entities based on their input.
+ Make the blackholes static.

##Notes
+ UML design was identified as an ongoing process that will span over all the sprints until release.
