##What worked well
+ Toggl - really helpful with managing and tracking time. Reports could be generated for insights
+ Git - good use of bitbucket during sprint, pushing major updates/changes
+ ReSharper - good use of R#, including code completion and code cleanup tools

##What could be improved
* Time estimation - most of the time estimates were off:
	* reading up on the physics
		* estimated - 2 hours
		* actual - 1 hour
		* dreason - I had prior knowledge of the subject
	* setting up CI pipeline
		* estimated - 2 hour
		* actual - 3.5 hours
		* reason - SwinGame was incompatible with BitBucket pipleines (external cause)
	* Note :- implenting the main classes + mechanics + GUi were estimated fairly accurately
