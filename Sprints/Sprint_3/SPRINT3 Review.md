#Sprint 1 Review
	Made the interface more appealing and intuitive with colours, predictive lines and path tracing lines.

##New features
+ Generates random colors for each new planet that is consistent with it's lines
+ Dahsed lines dynamically predicts the path of the planet before it is launched.
+ Solid lines traces the path of moving planets
+ planets are deleted when they hit a blackhole

##Features failed to add
+ Planets overlapping each other was not fixed. This was a design decision, as the product owner I have decided to leave it.

##Suggestions for the next Sprint
+ Keyboard inputs to toggle pause, overlap
+ Allow the user to create their own blackholes
+ Display the game's status and help guide
