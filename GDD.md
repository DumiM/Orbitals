# Game Design Document - Orbitals

## Gameplay
Orbitals is a gravity simulator that aims to spark creativity in the user. 
It allows to launch planets with a your mouse, and get them into stable orbits around black holes to create mesmerizing  patterns. Planets leave colored traces, so that you will have created a beautiful piece of art at the end of the orbit. The simulator also allows the user to see the future trajectory of a planet before they launch it.

### Goals
The goal of the simulator is to tap into the creative faculties of the user while making them fully appreciate the beauty of interplantery physics.

### User abilities
The user can place black holes and launch unlimted planets and control their starting sizes and velocties.

### Game Mechanics
The game will incoprate accurate newtonian gravity mechanics and a simplified algorithmic version of the n-body problem to simulate the gravity between all planets and black holes at any given time.

## Game Screens 
The final gmae screen wil have these features:
+ Black holes placed on the screen
+ Differenty coloured planets travelling at different velocities conforming to gravity
+ Coloured traces of the planets' paths
+ Aiming arc that helps the user plan the trajectory
